<h4>How Git Works (excerpt from : https://www.atlassian.com/git)</h4> 

<p>Here is a basic overview of how Git works:</p>
<ul>  
  <li>Create a "repository" (project) with a git hosting tool (like Bitbucket)</li>
  <li>Copy (or clone) the repository to your local machine</li>
  <li>Add a file to your local repo and "commit" (save) the changes</li>
  <li>"Push" your changes to your main branch</li>
  <li>Make a change to your file with a git hosting tool and commit</li>
  <li>"Pull" the changes to your local machine</li>
  <li>Create a "branch" (version), make a change, commit the change</li>
  <li>Open a "pull request" (propose changes to the main branch)</li>
  <li>"Merge" your branch to the main branch</li>
</ul>
